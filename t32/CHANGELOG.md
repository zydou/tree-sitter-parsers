  without error.

  are supported.

### Fixed

## [2.4.0] - 2023-09-13

### Changed

- Better support for scripts with both `(repeat_block)` in post condition format
  and `(while_block)` nodes. Ambiguities are resolved during runtime.

### Fixed

- Fix parsing of `(block)`, `(if_block)`, `(while_block)` and `(repeat_block)` nodes with
  additional line breaks.

  instead of integers numbers.
- Interpret node `(access_class)` as constant instead of number.

### Fixed

- Fix highlighting of `(identifier)` nodes as variables.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-07-23

### Added

- New node types for PRACTICE commands with HLL expressions, for example
  `(hll_update_expression)`.
- Integrated [tree-sitter-c](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c) C grammar with TRACE32® HLL extensions (range operator, symbols, ...)
